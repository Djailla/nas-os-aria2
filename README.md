NAS OS Empty App
==================================

This app is a basic container to test and prepare NAS OS applications. It's only including the default Debian Wheezy Lamp running on port 7575.

With this, you can enter the chroot using this command in NAS OS ssh as root :

`rainbow --enter empty`

Then you can run whatever command in debian like apt-get install.
